            <h2>1 Nephi 17:2</h2>
            <p>And so great were the blessings of the Lord upon us, that while we did live upon raw meat in the
                wilderness, our women did give plenty of suck for their children, and were strong, yea, even like unto
                the men; and they began to bear their journeyings without murmurings.</p>

            <h2>Alma 3:27</h2>
            <p>For every man receiveth wages of him whom he listeth to obey, and this according to the words of the
                spirit of prophecy; therefore let it be according to the truth. And thus endeth the fifth year of the
                reign of the judges.</p>
